- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iconium21
- A King may move a man, a father may claim a son, but remember 
that even when those who move you be Kings, or men of power, 
your soul is in your keeping alone. 
When you stand before God, you cannot say, 
"But I was told by others to do thus." Or that,
 "Virtue was not convenient at the time."
 This will not suffice. Remember that.
